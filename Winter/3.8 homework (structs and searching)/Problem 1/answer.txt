Binary search is MUCH faster, but has its drawbacks with the required condition.

As we have discussed, sorting is a prerequisite for the use of binary search. Sorting is O(n log n), while
linear search is O(n). However, you only need to sort a list once. So, if you need many queries, binary 
search is better.

In general, if a list is sorted, binary search is better. However, if you don't have many queries and the list
is unsorted, linear search is better. If sorting is also going to ruin your data, linear search is better since
we cannot sort. However, linear search is only good when we cannot sort or have small numbers of queries. Otherwise,
since binary search is MUCH faster, it is the method of choice.
