Stable and unstable sorting algorithims are two different categories of sorting algorithims. 
Unstable sorting algorithims are simply those that are not stable. An example of an unstable
sorting algorithim is an implementation of selection sort as seen in selection_sorting_unstable. 
The second element in the pair is a tracker whether it's stable or unstable - if they're in order
afterward, it's stable, else, it's unstable (which we see is selection sorting by output). The 
ordering of identical elements - shown in this example as the second element of pairs remaining 
the same is the difference between stable and unstable sorting - in stable sorting, it retains 
its original order, in unstable sorting, it does NOT.

Note - The way we can make this algorithim stable is by abusing the ID tags. We use the normal >
operator for pairs instead of only looking at the first element.
