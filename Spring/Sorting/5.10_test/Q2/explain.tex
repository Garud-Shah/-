Shell sort uses a series of increments and then sorts the list 
by repeatetly comparing $i$ and $i - inc$. Its comparisons push 
larger 
elements to the top, and its $O(n \cdot q)$ ($q$ average number 
of swaps) time comparison cycles.
with $O(\log n)$ cycles gives $O(qn \log n)$ time, uses 
$O(1)$ auxilary memory, but is unstable. Now, how about $q$?
It'll land in the middle of the elements on average (due to 
each cycle being a set of repeated insertion sorts). So, it's roughly
$O(n/s)$, $s$ being the cycle size. This means it's actually $O(n^2)$. 
Its grade is \textbf{C} due to this time complexity.
