Merge Sort recursively splits lists. First, it splits lists in half.
Then, it sorts the split lists using \\~\\
\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
    \item If the list has size not equal to one, do the following:
    \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
        \item Split the list into two sublists.
        \item Merge sort the first sublist.
        \item Merge sort the second sublist.
        \item Merge the two sublists, and return the output.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Else: immediately return. Do not perform any actions,
    as a 1-element list is sorted.
\end{enumerate}
Merging works by repeately adding elements from the sublists to a
merged list. It takes the minimum of all non-added elements 
(i.e. the minimum of the two lowest-index non-added element from a list)
and adds it to the list. Then, it increments counters for the 
elements of the list. Once all elements are added, the lists are merged.
