\section{Discussion}
The $O(1)$ memory complexity and stability are obvious buffs. However, these buffs are destroyed by its $O(n^2)$ time complexity. As 
previously mentioned: \newline
``... sorting is only very useful if the sorting algorithims time complexity is under $O(n^2)$'' \newline
I know this is true, especially where that $O(n)$ getting converted to $O(\log n)$ really matters, like in USACO problems that utilize sorting.
This severly limits the use of this algorithim.
\section{Algorithim Grade}
Because it is not very useful due to its high time complexity, but posesses some important features such as stability and low memory
complexity, this algorithim gets a \textbf{B}.
